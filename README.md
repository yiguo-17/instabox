# Instabox - A Subsidiary of Flexbook


### Introduction

Today we'll be making Instagram.

Well, not the functionality... but the layout, at least!

Well, no, not the _whole_ layout, of course... but the layout of a profile page, anyway.

Well, okay, not the layout of even one profile page. But the top of one.

It's still gonna be hard!

But it'll be a lot easier with Flexbox.


### Your Assignment

You'll be working on replicating this website:

### Guidelines


* All of the images have been given to you in assets. Use them!
* You don't have to EXACTLY match the layout. For example, does `justify-content: space-between` not quite work? Try `space-around` or `space-evenly` or `center` or _whatever is closest_ to the original layout. Don't sweat the small stuff, we're focusing on learning Flexbox.
* You may _not_ use any *general* layout tools _besides_ flexbox. You can use `margin` and `padding`, sure, but _only_ if you're using them to fix a one-off spacing issue, _not_ as a tool for laying out the page. For example, you could apply padding on the right of the item of a row, or a right padding to the row itself, because the spacing isn't quite right otherwise, but not to every item in a row. General rules for elements are for Flexbox; one-time adjustments to that are perfectly fine to apply to one element.
